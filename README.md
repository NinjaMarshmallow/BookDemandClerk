# Book Demand Clerk

Senior Project for Jason Klaassen and Josh Bussis.
This Web App is intended to be a virtual clerk to automate the process of collecting data about the demand 
for new books that the library has the potential to acquire

## Vision

This app is intended to automate an inefficient process of collecting the demand of various new publications 
that was previously done via chain emails. The Calvin University Hekman Library will be able to use this app 
to quickly and easily collect data about the demand by professors for various new publications to decide which
titles to buy for the library. The end goal is providing automation to the librarians so that this task is less
of a hassle.

## Primary Features

The Primary Objectives of this application will be:

  * Gathering preferences from professors in every department
  * Storing these preferences in a database
  * Providing a simple, easy-to-use interface for the library administrator to access and query the database
  

## Methods

The web app will be created with the Ionic Angular Framework with Typescript with an SQL database backend for storing data. 
Unit Tests will be used to attempt to limit the amount of serious bugs over the course of the project.
The App will include two different interfaces. One interface will be accessible by the professors to submit their preferences
for the new books. The second interface will be accessible by the library staff to review the collective preferences for the
new books to fuel their decision of what books to buy with their limited budget.
